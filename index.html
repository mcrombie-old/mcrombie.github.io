<h2> Ball Animation</h2>


<body>
	<div>
		<h3>Initial Storyboard</h3>
		<h4>The story follows a yellow ball as it bounces through a cave. As it comes to rest it is nearly licked up by a sentient potato! The story
		makes use of squash and stretch, anticipation, and arcs. </h4>
		<img src = "mcrombie.github.io/images/StoryBoard.jpg" width="560" height="315">
		
		<h3>Anticipation<h3>
		<h4>Anticipation created through the balls emerging smile as he is floating upward only to be smashed against the ceiling... </h4>

		<h3>Exaggeration<h3>
		<h4>The ball's fall after colliding with the ceiling shows an exaggerated stretched form of it's once chipper self plop back onto the ground. </h4>

		<h3>Secondary Action<h3>
		<h4>The potato's eye's follow the ball as it moves, which is not immediately obvious since the focus of attention is on the ball. </h4>
		<img src = "mcrombie.github.io/images/SecondaryAction.jpg" width="560" height="315">
		
		<h3>Squash and Stretch<h3>
		<h4>The ball's vertical size is reduce as it impact the ground and expands to beyond normal briefly as it moves back up before returning to normal. This creates the semblence of softness. </h4>
