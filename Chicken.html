<h1> A Chicken's Tale</h1>
<h1> 5/10/17</h1>

<h2>Assignment</h2>
<p>For this project, you must create a short animation, lasting 15-30 seconds, taking into account the
topics we covered this semester. You must model, animate, texture, light, and render everything
on your own, or in a small team approved beforehand. <br>
The final movie should be composed of rendered frames and saved in a standard format (e.g.,
.mov). Audio is not required, but encouraged. <br>
You are free to be as creative as you like with the animation â€“ try to make the final product
entertaining and incorporate as many of the Disney 12 animation principles as possible (e.g.,
squash and stretch, exaggeration, anticipation, etc.). As always, have fun with this project!</p>
