<h1> Unicycle Animation</h1>
<h1> 3/23/17</h1>

<h2>Assignment</h2>
<p>For this project, create a short animation running 10-20 seconds that features a unicycle following
a motion path. You may tell a short story in your animation, or simply show the unicycle following
an interesting path; however, strive for realistic (i.e., physics-based) movement. Feel free to
create environmental elements to enhance your animation, but at least include a ground plane to
give the unicycle a basis in space. You must employ at least three of the Disney 12 principles of
animation discussed in class.</p>

		<h3>Anticipation<h3>
