<h1> Rube Goldberg Machine Animation</h1>
<h1> 4/11/17</h1>

<h2>Assignment</h2>
<p>For this project, create a short animation running 10-20 seconds that features a Rube Goldberg Machine.
Include realistic (i.e., physics-based) movement using dynamics, as discussed in class. Feel
free to create environmental elements to enhance your animation, but include at least five different
objects that participate in the machine.</p>

		<h3>Initial Storyboard</h3>
		<h4>The erroneous story involves a wand guiding the eye of a hat monster back to its socket, and a ball of dough going down a slide to set off a process that cooks it into bread for the hat monster to eat. The bunny is for kicks. </h4>

		<h3>Hammer<h3>
		<h4>The hammer merely serves as a lever to position the eye ball for the wand to shoot it into the hat. </h4>
